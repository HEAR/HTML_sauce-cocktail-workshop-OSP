                PREFACE
              </h2>
              <p>
                The recipes in this little book have been sent by Belgian refugees from
                all parts of the United Kingdom, and it is through the kindness of these
                correspondents that I have been able to compile it. It is thought, also,
                that British cooking may benefit by the study of Belgian dishes.
              </p>
              <p>
                The perfect cook, like Mrs. 'Arris or the fourth dimension, is often heard
                of, but never <span class="adverb">actually</span> found, so this small manual is offered for the use
                of the work-a-day and inexperienced mistress and maid. It is not written
                in the interests of millionaires. The recipes are simple, and most
                inexpensive, rather for persons of moderate means than for those who can
                follow the famous directions for a&nbsp;certain savory: "Take a&nbsp;leg of mutton,"
                etc. A&nbsp;shelf of provisions should be valued, like love-making, not only
                for itself but for what it may become.
              </p>
              <p>
                SAVORIES: If you serve these, let them be, like an ankle, small and neat
                and alluring. This dish is not obligatory; recollect that it is but a
                culinary work of supererogation.
              </p>
              <p>
                SOUP: Let your soup be <span class="adverb">extremely</span> hot; do not let it be like the
                Laodiceans. You know what St. John said about them, and you would be sorry
                to think of your soup sharing the fate which he describes with such
                <span class="adverb">saintly</span> verve. Be sure that your soup has a&nbsp;good foundation, and avoid the
                Italian method of making <i>consommé</i>, which is to put a&nbsp;pot of water
                on to warm and to drive a&nbsp;cow past the door.
              </p>
              <p>
                FISH: It is a&nbsp;truism to say that fish should be <span class="adverb">absolutely</span> fresh, yet only
                too many cooks think, during the week-end, that fish is like the manna of
                the Hebrews, which was imbued with Sabbatarian principles that kept it
                fresh from Saturday to Monday. I implore of you to think <span class="adverb">differently</span> about
                fish. It is a&nbsp;most nourishing and strengthening food&mdash;other qualities
                it has, too, if one must believe the anecdote of the Sultan Saladin and
                the two anchorites.
              </p>
              <p>
                MEAT: If your meat must be cooked in water, let it not boil but <span class="adverb">merely</span>
                simmer; let the pot just whisper <span class="adverb">agreeably</span> of a&nbsp;good dish to come. Do you
                know what an English tourist said, looking into a&nbsp;Moorish cooking-pot?
                "What have you got there? Mutton and rice?" "For the moment, Sidi, it is
                mutton and rice," said the Moorish cook; "but in two hours, inshallah,
                when the garlic has kissed the pot, it will be the most delicious
                comforter from Mecca to Casa Blanca." Simmer and season, then, your meats,
                and let the onion (if not garlic) just kiss the pot, even if you allow no
                further intimacy between them. Use bay-leaves, spices, herbs of all sorts,
                vinegar, cloves; and never forget pepper and salt.

                Game is like Love, the best appreciated when it begins to go. Only
                experience will teach you, on blowing up the breast feathers of a
                pheasant, whether it ought to be cooked to-day or to-morrow. Men, as a
                rule, are very particular about the dressing of game, though they may not
                all be able to tell, like the Frenchman, upon which of her legs a
                partridge was in the habit of sitting. Game should be underdone rather
                than well done; it should never be without well-buttered toast underneath
                it to collect the gravy, and the knife to carve it with should be very,
                very sharp.

                VEGETABLES: <span class="adverb">Nearly</span> all these are at their best (like brunettes) just
                before they are <span class="adverb">fully</span> matured. So says a&nbsp;great authority, and no doubt he
                is thinking of young peas and beans, lettuces and asparagus. Try to dress
                such things as potatoes, parsnips, cabbages, carrots, in other ways than
                <span class="adverb">simply</span> boiled in water, for the water often removes the flavor and leaves
                the fiber. Do not let your vegetable-dishes remind your guests of
                Froissart's account of Scotchmen's food, which was "rubbed in a&nbsp;little
                water."

                SWEETS: It is difficult to give any general directions for sweets. They
                should be made to look attractive, and they should be <span class="adverb">constantly</span> varied.
                The same remarks <span class="adverb">apply</span> to savories, which last ought always to be <span class="adverb">highly</span>
                seasoned, whether hot or cold.
              </p>
              <p>
                MADE DISHES are a&nbsp;great feature in this little book. I have tried to help
                those small households who cook, let us say, a&nbsp;leg of mutton on Sunday,
                and then see it meander through the week in various guises till it ends
                its days honorable as soup on the following Friday. Endeavor to hide from
                your husband that you are making that leg of mutton almost achieve eternal
                life. It is noticeable that men are attracted to a&nbsp;house where there is
                good cooking, and the most unapproachable beings are rendered accessible
                by the pleasantness of a&nbsp;<i>soufflé</i>, or the aroma of a&nbsp;roast duck. You
                must have observed that a&nbsp;certain number of single men have their hearts
                very "wishful" towards their cook. Not <span class="adverb">infrequently</span> they marry that cook;
                but it is less that she is a&nbsp;good and charming woman than that she is a
                good and charming cook. Ponder this, therefore; for I have known men
                otherwise happy, who long for a&nbsp;good beef-steak pudding as <span class="adverb">vainly</span> as the
                Golden Ass longed for a&nbsp;meal of roses. Try these recipes, for <span class="adverb">really</span> good
                rissoles and hashes. Twice-cooked meat can always be alleviated by
                mushrooms or tomatoes. Remember that the discovery of a&nbsp;new dish is of
                more use than the discovery of a&nbsp;new star,&mdash;besides which, you will
                get much more praise for it. And if on Wednesday you find that you have to
                eat the same part of the very same animal that you had on Monday, do not,
                pray, become exasperated; treat it <span class="adverb">affectionately</span>, as I treat my black
                hat, which becomes more ravishing every time that I alter it. Only, do not
                buy extravagant make-weight for a&nbsp;scrap of cold meat that would be best
                used in a&nbsp;mince patty, or you will be like a&nbsp;man keeping a&nbsp;horse in order
                to grow mushrooms.
              </p>
              <p>
                And, <span class="adverb">lastly</span>, the good cook must learn about food what every sensible woman
                learns about love&mdash;how best to utilize the cold remains.

                      thick, cut in two lengthwise; cut off the green tops; leaving only the
                      blanched piece of stalk; put them into boiling salted water and cook
                      <span class="adverb">thoroughly</span> about one hour: strain and dish <span class="adverb">neatly</span> on a&nbsp;fish-drainer. Have
                      ready some hard-boiled eggs; shell them, cut in two, and place round the
                      leeks; serve hot with melted butter, or cold with mayonnaise sauce.

                    <p>
                      N. B. The water in which the leeks have been boiled makes a&nbsp;wholesome
                      drink when cold, or a&nbsp;nourishing basis for a&nbsp;vegetable soup.

                    <p>
                      To make a&nbsp;tomato salad you must not slice the fruit in a&nbsp;dish and then
                      pour on it a&nbsp;little vinegar and then a&nbsp;little oil; that is not salad&mdash;that
                      is ignorance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Take some red tomatoes, and, if you can procure them, some golden ones
                      also. Plunge each for a&nbsp;moment in boiling water, peel off the skin, but
                      <span class="adverb">carefully</span>, so as not to cut through the flesh with the juice. Take some
                      raw onion cut in slices; if you do not like the strong taste, use shallot;
                      and lay four or five flat slices on the bottom of the salad dish. Put the
                      tomato slices over them, sprinkle with salt and just a&nbsp;dust of castor
                      sugar. In four hours lift the tomatoes and remove the onions altogether.
                      Make in a&nbsp;cup the following sauce: Dissolve <span class="measure">a&nbsp;salt-spoonful</span> of salt in <span class="measure">a&nbsp;teaspoonful</span> of tarragon vinegar. Stir in <span class="measure">a&nbsp;dessert-spoonful</span> of oil,
                      dropping it <span class="adverb">slowly</span> in, add a&nbsp;very little mustard, some pepper and a
                      sprinkle of chopped chervil. Some people like chopped chives. Pour this
                      over the tomato salad and leave it for an hour at least before serving it.

                      Every one likes this nourishing dish, and it is a&nbsp;cheap one. Peel some
                      potatoes and cut them in rounds. In a&nbsp;fireproof dish put a&nbsp;layer of these,
                      sprinkle them with flour, grated cheese, pepper, salt, a&nbsp;few pats of
                      butter. Then some more potatoes, and so on till the dish is full. Beat the
                      yolks of two eggs in <span class="measure">a&nbsp;pint</span> of milk, add pepper and salt and pour it over
                      the dish. Leave it on the top of the stove for five minutes, then cook it
                      for half-an-hour in a&nbsp;moderate oven. Less time may be required if the dish
                      is small, but the potatoes must be <span class="adverb">thoroughly</span> cooked. The original recipe
                      directs Gruyère cheese, but red or pale Canadian Cheddar could be used.

                      in boiling water. When the butter simmers, throw in <span class="measure">a&nbsp;pound</span> of picked

                      difficulty of the dish is over. Put the saucepan further on the fire, let

                      mince. Close them, keeping the leaves very neat, and, if necessary, tie
                      them round again. Put them in a&nbsp;fire-proof dish with a&nbsp;lump of butter on
                      each, and let them heat through. Serve them in their juice or with more of
                      the white sauce, taking care to remove the threads.

                      trouble with it, they will have a&nbsp;dinner of the most delicious. Put into a
                      deep dish that will hold your shoulder of mutton the following mixture:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <span class="measure">a&nbsp;cupful</span> each of oil, vinegar, white wine, red wine, an onion stuffed with
                      cloves, a&nbsp;bunch of herbs which must be fresh ones&mdash;thyme, parsley,
                      marjoram, sage, a&nbsp;tiny bit of mint, a&nbsp;few bay-leaves&mdash;two medium
                      carrots cut in slices. Put the shoulder of mutton in this mixture and keep
                      it there for four days, turning it every now and then and pouring the
                      mixture on it. On the fifth day take it out, and, if you care to take the
                      trouble, you will improve it by larding the meat here and there. Put it to
                      roast in front of a&nbsp;good fire, with your liquor, which serves to baste it
                      with, in a&nbsp;pan beneath. If you cannot arrange to hang the mutton by a
                      string to turn like a&nbsp;roasting jack, then bake it, and <span class="adverb">continually</span> baste
                      it. A&nbsp;small shoulder is most successful. For one of <span class="measure">four pounds</span> bake for
                      fifty minutes.

                      of <span class="measure">four pounds</span>. For a&nbsp;piece of <span class="measure">four pounds</span>, cook first of all four large

                      colored, and sauté it; that is, keep moving the meat about <span class="adverb">gently</span>. Take
                      the meat out and place it on a&nbsp;dish. Add to the fat <span class="measure">two dessert-spoonsful</span>

                      colored. Pour on it a&nbsp;little gravy, or meat-juice of some kind, and let it
                      simmer for ten minutes after it begins to steam again. Then take your
                      beef, which must be cold, and cut in small slices; throw them in and let
                      it all cook for a&nbsp;quarter of an hour, only simmering, and <span class="adverb">constantly</span>

                      This is a&nbsp;winter dish; it is most sustaining, and once made, it can be
                      kept hot for hours without spoiling. Make a&nbsp;purée of lentils or peas, and
                      season it with pepper and salt. Mince your beef with an equal quantity of
                      peeled chestnuts, add chopped parsley, a&nbsp;dust of nutmeg or a&nbsp;few cloves.
                      If you have any cheap red wine pour it over the mince till it is well
                      moistened. If you have no red wine, use gravy. If you have no gravy, use
                      milk. Let all heat up in the oven for ten minutes, then sprinkle in some
                      currants or sultanas. Take the dish you wish to serve it in, put the stew
                      in the middle, and place the purée round it. If the mince is moist it can
                      be kept by the fire till required, or the dish can be covered with another
                      one and placed in a&nbsp;carrying-can, taken out to skating or shooting
                      parties.

                      yolk. While they are boiling and afterwards cooling in water, make a&nbsp;small
                      quantity of mayonnaise sauce. Peel the eggs, cut them through lengthways,
                      and take out the yolks. Crumble these with a&nbsp;little chopped herbs, and add
                      the mayonnaise. Fill the eggs with this mixture, and place them in a&nbsp;dish
                      with chopped lettuce round it, to which you may add a&nbsp;little more of the
                      sauce.

                    <p>
                      I think that boiled meat when cold is often neglected as being tasteless,
                      but, prepared as I will show you, it will deserve your approval.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Mince your boiled meat and put it into a&nbsp;thick white sauce well-spiced
                      with pepper, salt, and nutmeg, and let it remain for two hours. Then
                      prepare your croquettes by rolling the mixture in white of egg and fine
                      breadcrumbs. Put a&nbsp;piece of butter in the saucepan, sufficient to take all
                      the croquettes, and let them brown in it for about ten minutes. A&nbsp;white
                      sauce served with them is a&nbsp;good addition.

                      it is hot enough. Break an egg into a&nbsp;little flat dish, tip up the frying

                      tomatoes, pepper and salt. Let it cook for three or four minutes in the

                      Then break on the top of this custard as many eggs as you wish; sprinkle
                      with pepper and salt. Let it remain in the oven till these last are
                      beginning to set. Take out the dish, and pass over the top the salamander,
                      or the shovel, red hot, and serve at once. I have seen this dish with the
                      two extra whites of eggs beaten and placed in a&nbsp;pile on the top, and
                      <span class="adverb">slightly</span> browned by the shovel.

                      All the above recipes can be followed using sardines instead of anchovies,
                      and indeed one can use them in many other ways, with eggs, with lettuce,
                      with tomatoes. As anchovies are rather expensive to buy, I give a&nbsp;recipe
                      for mock anchovies, which is easy to do, but it must be done six months
                      before using the fish.

                      a&nbsp;peck. Do not either wipe or wash them. Take <span class="measure">four ounces</span> of saltpeter, <span class="measure">a

                      then add a&nbsp;little cochineal to color it, pound and mix very well. Take a
                      stone jar and put in it a&nbsp;layer of the mixture and a&nbsp;layer of the sprats,
                      on each layer of fish adding three or four bay leaves and a&nbsp;few whole
                      pepper-corns. Fill up the jar and press it all down very <span class="adverb">firmly</span>. Cover

                      A&nbsp;BROWN DISH OF FISH
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                      Take your fish, which should be herring or mackerel, relieve it of the
                      bones, skin and fins, which you must put to boil for three quarters of an
                      hour in water, with pepper and salt. After that time strain off the
                      liquor, and add to it enough browning to color it well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Then brown <span class="measure">quarter of a&nbsp;pound</span> of butter and knead into it <span class="measure">two tablespoonfuls</span> of flour, add it, when well mixed, to your liquor, with
                      salt and pepper, a&nbsp;piece of lemon peel, and a&nbsp;dust of mixed spice. Bring
                      all this to the boil and drop in your fish. (Cut in neat fillets.) Let
                      them simmer for twenty minutes, and if too dry pour in some <span class="adverb">darkly</span> colored
                      gravy. Just before you wish to serve add a&nbsp;good wine glass of claret, or
                      of Burgundy, take out the lemon peel, and pour all on a&nbsp;hot dish. If you
                      do not wish to put wine, the flavor of the sauce is very excellent if you
                      stir into it <span class="measure">a&nbsp;dessertspoonful</span> of mushroom ketchup, or <span class="measure">a&nbsp;teaspoonful</span> of

                                eaten raw while the meat was burnt. Because your dining-room furniture is
                                <span class="adverb">Early</span> English, there is no reason why the cooking should be <span class="adverb">early</span> English

                                corollary that the dinner must be better than usual. In such a&nbsp;moment of

                                and there are plenty of motifs in that way besides parsley. One can use

                                contemplated. "Sir," he said, "I could write a&nbsp;better book of cookery than
                                has ever yet been written. It should be a&nbsp;book on philosophical
                                principles."

                                Perhaps the pies of Fleet Street reminded him of the Black Broth of the

                                before serving. It should never boil after the cream is put in. A&nbsp;little
                                mace is usual, but no onions or shallot. A&nbsp;simple variety is made with

                                that the eggs are only just set and no more.

                                very presentable dish in the following way: Cut a&nbsp;thin slice of meat and
                                spread on each side of it a&nbsp;layer of mashed potatoes to which you have
                                added some tomato sauce. Beat up an egg and dip the slices and potato into

                                lettuce plenty of sliced cucumber, for that keeps the mutton moist. Put
                                the salad on each slice and roll the meat over as <span class="adverb">tightly</span> as you can. Lay

                                Jellies that are very well flavored can be made with fresh fruit,
                                raspberries, strawberries, apricots, or even rhubarb, using the
                                proportions of <span class="measure">one ounce</span> of gelatine (in cold weather) to every pound of
                                fruit puree. In hot weather use a&nbsp;little less gelatine. As the fruit
                                <span class="adverb">generally</span> gives a&nbsp;bad color, you must use cochineal for the red jellies
                                and a&nbsp;little green coloring for gooseberry jellies. The gelatine is of
                                course melted in the fruit puree and all turned into a&nbsp;mold. You can make
                                your own green coloring in this way. Pick <span class="measure">a&nbsp;pound</span> of spinach, throwing
                                away the stalks and midrib. Put it on in a&nbsp;pan with a&nbsp;little salt and keep
                                the cover down. Let it boil for twelve minutes. Then put a&nbsp;fine sieve over
                                a&nbsp;basin and pour the spinach water through it. Strain the spinach water
                                once or twice through muslin; it will be a&nbsp;good color and will keep some
                                time. Orange and lemon jellies are much more wholesome when made at home
                                than those made from bought powders. To the juice of every six oranges you
                                should add the juice of one lemon, and you will procure twice as much
                                juice from the fruit if, just before you squeeze it, you let it soak in
                                hot water for three or four minutes.

                                Mix the custard with the gooseberries, pass it through the sieve once more
                                and serve it in a&nbsp;crystal bowl.

                                Make some Genoese cake mixture as you would for a&nbsp;light cake, and pour it
                                into greased molds like cups. You can take the weight of one egg in dried
                                flour, butter, and rather less of sugar. Beat the butter and sugar
                                together to a&nbsp;cream, sprinkle in the flour, stirring all the time, a&nbsp;pinch
                                of salt, and then the beaten egg. When your little cakes are baked, turn
                                them out of the molds and when cool turn them upside down and remove the
                                inside, leaving a&nbsp;deep hole and a&nbsp;thin crust all round. Fill up this hole
                                with the custard and chocolate as above, and let it grow firm. Then turn
                                the cases right way up and pour over the top a&nbsp;sweet cherry sauce. You may
                                require the yolks of two eggs to make the custard firm.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed. 
Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a&nbsp;United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, <span class="adverb">apply</span> to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a&nbsp;registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for <span class="adverb">nearly</span> any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
<span class="adverb">practically</span> ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, <span class="adverb">especially</span> commercial
redistribution.
*** START: FULL LICENSE ***
THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can <span class="adverb">easily</span> <span class="adverb">comply</span> with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.
1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.
1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear <span class="adverb">prominently</span>
whenever any copy of a&nbsp;Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:
This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org
1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a&nbsp;notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a&nbsp;work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must <span class="adverb">comply</span> either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.
1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a&nbsp;means of exporting a&nbsp;copy, or a&nbsp;means of obtaining a&nbsp;copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
1.E.7.  Do not charge a&nbsp;fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are <span class="adverb">legally</span> required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be <span class="adverb">clearly</span> marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a&nbsp;user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a&nbsp;physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.
- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a&nbsp;full refund of any

     of receipt of the work.
- You <span class="adverb">comply</span> with all other terms of this agreement for free

electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.
1.F.
1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a&nbsp;copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a&nbsp;defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.
1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a&nbsp;Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a&nbsp;refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a&nbsp;physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a&nbsp;replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work <span class="adverb">electronically</span>, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a&nbsp;second opportunity to
receive the work <span class="adverb">electronically</span> in lieu of a&nbsp;refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a&nbsp;refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.
1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise <span class="adverb">directly</span> or <span class="adverb">indirectly</span> from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.
Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain <span class="adverb">freely</span> available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a&nbsp;secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org
Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
<span class="adverb">freely</span> distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are <span class="adverb">particularly</span> important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
International donations are <span class="adverb">gratefully</span> accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a&nbsp;number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate
Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a&nbsp;library of electronic works that could be <span class="adverb">freely</span> shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a&nbsp;loose network of volunteer support.
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a&nbsp;copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not <span class="adverb">necessarily</span>
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
     www.gutenberg.org
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

Workshop Open Source Publishing
Une fondue de mise en page web et papier (en hiver) ou un cocktail de class pour été.
Par ses contraintes de tailles d'écrans - multiple devis -, la mise en page web se doit d'être adaptative, quelque part consciente de l'environnement dans lequel elle s'installe. De ce point de vue, elle s'oppose au design imprimé où la plupart des interfaces traditionnelles tiennent nos mains sur les blocs durs de Gutenberg.
Approche structurelle / approche visuelle
Remettre le contenu en avant, à sa place. D'abord visser les articulations du texte avant de le déplier sur tel ou tel format. 
À quels paramètres peut s'accrocher le metteur en page papier sur le web, 
quelle part de lâcher-prise ?
Jusqu'où peut-on ajuster les réglages typographiques à partir d'un langage balisé
Un même contenu est-il adaptable à différents formats papier? 
L'atelier propose d'approcher la mise en forme d'un texte de manière liquide, de débrancher les réflexes de blocs
À partir d'un contenu HTML texte et image, riche de plusieurs niveaux hiérarchiques, nous proposons de travailler sur une/des mises/s en forme vers le papier en constituant des équipes, chacune travaillant sur un format de sortie différent (basées sur une liste de formats arbitraires, par exemple les formats proposés par les services d'impression à la demande de type Lulu ou Blurb ou une liste de formats représentatifs des différents mouvements de l'histoire imprimée)
En définissant un ensemble de *médias queries* les étudiants  construisent ensemble une feuille de style commune, mais posent chacun  les conditions qui vont identifier / typographier leur format.
Intervenants : Stéphanie Vilayphiou et Colm O'Neill
avec les étudiants en communication graphique de la Haute École des Arts du Rhin (H.E.A.R.) de Strasbourg :
So-Hyun Bae, Laura Burucoa, Charlotte Chowdurry, Victor Donati, Montasser Drissi, Angéline Girard, Manon Hachad, Quentin Juhel, Romain Goetz, Lisa Pagès, Hugo Serraz, Clara Neumann, Lena Robin, Arman Mohtadji, Benjamin Riollet, Théophile Martin, Caroline Sorin.
